				<h4>Hello and Welcome! Thank you for choosing to work with me, the Web Design Assistant, and taking the first step on your journey to make your own website. I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you want your website to look, feel and work.<br><br>You will be expected to provide content such as text, pictures, and links to other websites, but I will do the difficult work of placing them on the website for you, and making sure they all fit together properly.<br><br>If at any point I say something that confuses you, or if you'd just like more information before making a decision, click the "Get Help" links below each question. If this is your first time making a website, I strongly recommend clicking these buttons anyway, so you can learn about the context of what you are doing as you go along.<br><br>When you're ready to get started, click the "Begin" button below!</h4>
