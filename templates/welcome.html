			<h4>Hello and Welcome!</h4>

			<p>Thank you for choosing the Web Design Assistant, and taking the first step on your journey to make your own website. I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you want your website to look, feel and work. You will be expected to provide content such as text, pictures, and links to other websites, but I will do the difficult work of placing them on the website for you, and making sure they all fit together properly. If at any point I say something that confuses you, or if you'd just like more information before making a decision, click the "Help" icons next to each question.</p>
			<p>When you're ready to started, click the "Begin" button below!</p>
